### Readme for the skeleton flagswitch
### by MEEEB
### v1 rev1
### new files and changed file list


Hello potential user,

In this document, I will give a quick rundown on how to use this.


But first, the usage policy:

You can use and modify this code to your liking, though you shall always credit me as the original author (which should be taken care of, as I credited myself at the start of all files).

That's it.


In it's original form, this (skeleton) mod consists of:

/events/skeleton_flagswitch_events.txt
/gfx/flags/medium/delete_me.txt
/gfx/flags/small/delete_me.txt
/gfx/flags/delete_me.txt
/localisation/skeleton_flagswitch_events_l_english.yml
/notes_by_MEEEB.txt (this file)

and:

../skeleton_flagswitch.mod


How to use this mod as a base:

1. Rename skeleton_flagswitch_events.txt and skeleton_flagswitch_events_l_english.yml to something fitting your intent (e.g. GER_flagswitch...).
2. Follow the instructions in the respective files.
3. Put your gfx (the flags) in their respective folders (check the wiki for instructions, if necessary).
4. Create a readme (optional) and keep this file just to be safe (also optional).
5. Rename the mod folder (skeleton_flagswitch)
6. Rename skeleton_flagswitch.mod and follow the intructions inside of it.
7. You're done and can now upload a functional mod (check the wiki if you don't know how that works).



I hope you put this to good use,


 - MEEEB
